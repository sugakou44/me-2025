{#snippet captainDescription()}
  I spent most of my time here building apps with React Native and Next.js,
  making sure they looked good.
  <br />
  Kicked off project for a graphical interface builder for a delivery-tracking app.
  aside from our own backend,
  <br />
  I also integrated a headless CMS (Directus) via GraphQL; connected third-party
  services such as Pusher, Firebase, GraphHopper and MapBox.

  Here, I mostly worked on PDPA products and design systems, using Chakra UI,
  Emotion, and Storybook. I got to play with cool stuff like an audio
  visualizer, helped integrate LMS platforms, and created prototypes to make
  life easier for the product and sales teams. I also handled CI/CD setups with
  GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and Kubernetes for project I kicked off.

  room detection based on floor plans using OpenCV; and set up CI/CD pipelines
  using GitLab Runner.

  On the side, I’ve been exploring 3D and interactive experiences, creating 360°
  exhibition spaces with Three.js, building REST APIs with Nestjs.
